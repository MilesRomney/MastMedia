MAST awards a 2019 Micro-docs Honorable Mention to _Salsa Mocajete"_, a film by An Dinh and Alhondra Lopez.

A young woman from Michoacan, Mexico shares her family's salsa recipe and reflects on the current political climate.

Salsa Molcajete transforms a few humble ingredients into a rich and singular taste handed down from mother to daughter. For Magali, an 18 y.o. Mexican immigrant, the taste transcends borders and time to empower her journey as a new American.

> Dreams take flight and make us live. I’m from Moroleon Guanajuato, Mexico and I am 20 years old. I’m completing my last year at Salt Lake Community College after four years in the United States. I’m proud to say that despite the obstacles I face as a bilingual woman of color, part of my dream has finally come true. Film has a special place in my heart. I seek truth and beauty through it. This began as a dream and has evolved into career goal. I want to make movies that show the reality of our world and teach a way to change it. I believe that through small steps, anyone can build something bigger than themselves. My inspiration comes from my values, culture, and beliefs. 

> This movie isn’t about how to make Mexican salsa, it’s about a girl that has a story to tell. A heart that has to face ever-changing obstacles and overcoming society’s challenges. I hope everyone that watches this film empathizes with Magali and never gives up on their dreams because everybody has something of value.
