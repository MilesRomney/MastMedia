A MAST nod to Jenny Harder's creative animated short, _Being Good_.

<star></star>

**What made you want to get into the animation industry?**

**Jenny:** I am a big fan of Disney films and always loved the idea of creating my own characters and stories.

<br /><br />

**What was your first job in the industry?**

**Jenny:** An internship as a general artist, doing concepts, 2D animations etc.

<br /><br />


**What was your favorite character to animate?**

**Jenny:** For BEING GOOD that was Mal, we had to get a lot of subtle expressions across while Ava was more straightforward in her acting.

<br /><br />


**What inspired the theme of this piece, and how does it vary from your other work?**

**Jenny:** We wanted to create a proof of concept. It is very subtle but we wanted to highlight that the terms good and bad are very subjective depending on who we are and what we believe in. Also, Mal and Ava don't appear to be 100% good or bad either, which is exactly the point.

<br /><br />

**How do you keep up with animation trends?**

**Jenny:** Watch everything there is, but then make sure to develop your own voice when you work on something.

<br /><br />

**What advice or tips would you give to those trying to pursue animation/build a portfolio on a budget?**

**Jenny:** Check out www.Artella.com, we found a lot of great people there that were willing to help us out.

<br /><br />


**What are some of your favorite projects you're proud to have been a part of?**

**Jenny:** Working on Disney Infinity, For Honor and 100% Wolf are certainly my favorites.

<br /><br />

**Tell us a little about the tools that you are using, what's your preference? Plugins? Methods?**

**Jenny:** Artella is a great platform with everything you need to make a short film. It helps to get Slack for communication and Frame.io for video reviews.

<br /><br />

**Do you look for imperfections in your work?**

**Jenny:** Yes, the little quirks and funny characteristics can make your work more unique and realistic. Something too polished might feel fake.

<br /><br />

**Who influenced you the most in the animation industry?**

**Jenny:** People I met at industry meetups and conventions, people that inspired me to reach for more. Surrounding myself with like minded people is very important to me.

<br /><br />

**If you could choose to work with any artist (past, present) from the animation business, who would it be and why?**

**Jenny:** Cory Loftis, I just love his approach to character design.

<br /><br />

**Is there any advice you can give to an aspiring animation student or artist trying to get into the animation or gaming business?**

**Jenny:** Prepare to do the hard work to get in, it gets easier. But don't be afraid to say no either. It's important to have a healthy work-life balance.
